# Iconic üìÅ

Iconic lets you easily add images on top of a folder icon. It is mostly meant for Gnome. 
This application is my first attempt at creating an application using Rust and Libadwaita.

## Todo üìù

These are ideas I want to implement.
### New features
- [ ] Add more visual guide to show how changing a folder icon in nautilus works
- [ ] Add an option to force regenerate icons with non-accent following colors
    - If the user wants to add adwaita colors later while using iconic, that is not really supported
- [ ] Make it more clear when icons can be regenerated and when not
- [ ] not recreate monochrome images every preview update
    - Monochrome images get recreated every time the preview is updated. Slows down quite a lot on slower systems, i could also
- [ ] Export to SVG
    - This would probably require a full rewrite of the image generation system. Using cairo or something, but I originally didn't use cairo as I did not understand it, and good examples were really scarse 
- [ ] Rounded corner option for top image
- [ ] Add guide grid or something
- [ ] Refer users to icon library, so they know where to find many good icons
    - I already do this in the description, but maybe somewhere in the app itself also?
- [ ] Show how many files are regenerated and how many are left during regeneration

### Environment improvements
- [ ] Make donation link just point to a random charity
- [ ] Set up CI/CD Pipeline
    - A pipeline for dev, i do not think i need. But for main would be really handy. Especially with translation files
- [ ] Use better sollution for managing translations
- [X] Apply for [gnome circle](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Circle#how-to-apply)
- [ ] Create tests
    - It has now happened several times, that I release an update and it turns out a feature of the app is completely broken. That is not acceptable

### General goals
- Clean up code
    - Reduce unwraps
        - I feel like a lot of code is not up to "standards" like rust conventions and stuff, So I need to do some research into that. 
- Add comments
    - I struggled a lot learning it all, So adding comments, especially at points I got stuck, might help other devs also wanting to learn 
- Reduce file size
    - I the app is about 17 mb's, way to much for such a simple app imo. I might use a lot of large libs (Like cairo) only for a single purpose, so possibly that could be improved.

## Contributing ü§ù
This program is mostly meant as practise for me so I want to solve most problems by myself. So the best will be to create an issue if you encounter any.
If you want to create a merge request. That is off course totally fine, but please try not to fundamentally change how it works and clearly explain what you did and how it works üòÅ

## Running the app üèÉ
If you want to run the app:
1. Clone the repo
2. Open it in [gnome-builder](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.Builder)
3. Start the application by pressing `ctrl+shift+escape`

## Credits ü´Ç
Wow documentation is really hard to understand so I used few programs as inspiration and to learn how everything works, so massive shout-out to:
- Eyedropper - https://github.com/FineFindus/eyedropper
- Switcheroo - https://gitlab.com/adhami3310/Switcheroo
- Geopard - https://github.com/ranfdev/Geopard
- Obfuscate - https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/obfuscate
- Loupe - https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/loupe

### Icon credits
The icon is just a few already existing icons added together, the following are used:
- Gnome text editor - https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-text-editor
- Adwaita icons - https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/adwaita-icon-theme

### Folder credits
The folders/colors used in Iconic are taken from 
- Adwaita-Colors - https://github.com/dpejoh/Adwaita-colors/tree/main

## Code of Conduct üö®
This app follows the [Gnome Code of Conduct](https://conduct.gnome.org/)
